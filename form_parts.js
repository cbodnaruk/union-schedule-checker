It specifically lists two main scenarios, providing detailed feedback on work written at an honours or postgraduate level (4xxx and above), as well as working as the lead marker in a group of markers, or moderating the marking of an assessment (typically only necessary in much larger units). <br /> The other category, "Routine" marking, covers the rest of cases, namely all marking at 3xxx level and below. <br /> The union is fighting to expand the coverage of the higher category.</span>'

Classes where you are required to prepare content in advance, and will be teaching and expanding upon materials discussed in the lectures are paid at the Tutor rate. This includes classes where, for instance, problem sets are provided by the coordinator in advance. The NTEU believes there has been a substantial level of misclassification of casual in some parts of the university, who have been classified as Demonstrators where they should have been Tutors.</span>'
